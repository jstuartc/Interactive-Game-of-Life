The Input contain a setup for a range of senarios
- Different sized boards
- Different Authors and names in a random order with some having the same names and different authors
- A variety of different setups

This enabled me to test
- How the game reacted for different senarios
- That my ordering system for Patterns worked
- That the code was able to read multiple different patterns from the test code and work
- What happens if I change pattern in the middle of the game running
